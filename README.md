# Bank-Churners-Analysis
## Overview
This project presents an analysis of customer churn in a bank using SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization. The objective is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention. By leveraging SQL and Power BI, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the bank to reduce churn rates and increase customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The bank churn dataset contains historical customer data, including the following attributes:

- Customer ID

- Gender

- Age

- Account Balance

- Credit Score

- Number of Products

- IsActiveMember (binary indicator)

- Estimated Salary

- Exited (target variable - whether the customer churned or not)

## Analysis Highlights

### Data Preparation with SQL

- Loaded the bank churn dataset into a SQL database.

- Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

- Extracted relevant features for analysis, such as customer demographics, account information, and churn status.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed the distribution of customer demographics, account balances, credit scores, and other key attributes.

- Visualized the relationship between different features and customer churn using SQL queries and Power BI visualizations.

### Churn Analysis

- Calculated the churn rate and identified trends over time.

- Investigated the reasons for churn based on customer characteristics, account activity, and other factors.

## Result

1)The number of customers churning in the age range of '40-50' years is highest followed by 50-60 years.

2)The number of 'FEMALES" are higher in the churned customers.

3)The possibility of a 'FEMALE' customer attriting is higher than that of a 'MALE' customer.

4)Customers in Germany are more likely to churn.

5)The non-active customers are more likely to churn.

6)Its a no brainer that those who have spent less time with the bank will churn.

7)We can summarize that lesser the utilisation on the customer's card the higher the chance of attrition.

## Insights and Recommendations
Identified demographic and behavioral patterns associated with churn, such as age, account balance, and product usage.
Proposed actionable recommendations to improve customer retention, such as targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, and enhanced customer support initiatives.
Highlighted the importance of proactive churn management strategies to mitigate customer attrition and maximize customer lifetime value.

## Conclusion
The Bank Churn Analysis project provides valuable insights into customer churn and retention strategies. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization, we have identified key factors influencing churn rates and proposed actionable recommendations to improve customer retention. These insights can inform strategic decision-making processes for the bank, enabling them to develop targeted interventions to reduce churn rates and enhance customer satisfaction.
